# Ola Monthly Performance Report
This project analyzes monthly raw data from Ola, an online cab service platform, to gain insights into key performance metrics. 

Our primary focus is on three critical areas:
1. Overall Booking & Revenue – Evaluating total bookings, revenue distribution and Rides Volume.
2. Vehicle-wise Breakup – Analyzing demand distribution across different vehicle categories.
3. Cancellations & Ratings – Understanding cancellation patterns and customer feedback trends.

To present our findings in a clear and actionable manner, we have developed a Power BI dashboard that transforms raw data into interactive visualizations. 
This dashboard enhances readability and provides stakeholders with a comprehensive view of Ola’s monthly performance.
Through this analysis, we aim to identify trends, optimize operational efficiency, and improve customer experience

# 🚖 Ola Monthly Performance Report

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to a project where data meets real-world decision-making. This is more than just charts and numbers—it's a story about how **Ola**, one of India’s leading ride-hailing platforms, performs month over month.

Using **Power BI**, I’ve transformed raw operational data into an intuitive dashboard that helps uncover patterns, highlight challenges, and guide better business decisions.

## 🎯 What’s This All About?

Every month, Ola generates tons of data—from rides booked and canceled, to customer feedback and vehicle demand. This project brings structure to that chaos by focusing on **what actually matters**:

### 🔍 Core Focus Areas:
1. **📈 Bookings & Revenue**  
   Get the pulse of the business by tracking total ride volumes and revenue trends.

2. **🚗 Vehicle-Wise Insights**  
   See which vehicle categories (Mini, Prime, Auto, etc.) are leading the game—and which ones need a boost.

3. **❌ Cancellations & ⭐ Ratings**  
   Understand *why* customers cancel and what they’re really saying through their feedback.

## 📊 The Power BI Dashboard

Let’s face it—nobody enjoys digging through messy spreadsheets. So I built a clean, **interactive Power BI dashboard** that makes exploring this data simple, insightful, and even a bit fun.

### ✅ What You’ll Find:
- Filterable views across vehicles, dates, and regions  
- Clear KPIs for quick decision-making  
- Drill-downs to explore deeper trends  
- Sleek visuals that speak louder than raw numbers
